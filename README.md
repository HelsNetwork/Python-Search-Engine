# Python-Search-Engine

For the [Final Project of CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) of the Harvard-provided CS50 course, I developed this simple Python search engine. I collected all the Python-related questions and descriptions using the bs4 module and stored them in a mongo db. I then created the web application using HTML and Jinja.
